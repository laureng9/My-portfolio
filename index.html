                    <p>
                        Welcome to my portfolio! Having spent seven fulfilling years as an educator, I embarked on a
                        transformative journey during Covid-19 lockdown in 2020 when I discovered a newfound interest in
                        coding. As the world slowed down, my curiosity for technology accelerated, leading me to immerse
                        myself in the fascinating realm of coding.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While balancing part-time teaching responsibilities, 2022 marked the beginning of my formal
                        coding education through Codecademy. Fast forward to July 2023, I made the pivotal decision to
                        bid farewell to teaching and fully commit to the world of coding. This portfolio serves as a
                        testament to my transition, capturing the fusion of my extensive teaching background with the
                        evolving skills and passion I've cultivated on my coding odyssey.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Join me as I demonstrate the harmonious blend of knowledge and technology in this thrilling
                        phase of my professional journey.
